            The Velocity Vortex GT pays homage to the legendary Shelby Daytona
            Coupe, renowned for its 1960s racing successes. This modern
            interpretation seamlessly combines classic aesthetics with
            cutting-edge performance and safety features, making it an
            exceptional choice for enthusiasts looking for a car that’s equally
            at home on the track and the street.

            The heart of this beast is a 5.2-liter V8 engine, purportedly
            delivering a robust 600 horsepower, although a dyno sheet is not
            included to verify this claim. The power is efficiently routed to
            the rear wheels through a responsive 6-speed manual transmission.
