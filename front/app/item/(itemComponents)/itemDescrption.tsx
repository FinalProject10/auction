        <p>
          Introducing the 2021 Velocity Vortex GT, a masterpiece in automotive
          engineering, featuring a stunning white exterior and a sleek black
          interior. Transmission enthusiasts will be delighted by the 6-speed
          manual gearbox, offering a direct connection to the road. The odometer
          proudly displays just around 900 miles, a testament to the care this
          vehicle has received. Our recent review by automotive expert Alanis
          King of Cars & Bids, which can be found in the video below, highlights
          the incredible features of the Velocity Vortex GT. Notable equipment
          includes state-of-the-art Hotchkiss electronic coilovers, Ridetech
          triple adjustable shocks, high-performance Willwood brakes, 19-inch
          Forgeline wheels, a carbon fiber wing, racing seats and harnesses by
          Racetech, and more, as elaborated below. The Velocity Vortex GT pays
          homage to the legendary Shelby Daytona Coupe, renowned for its 1960s
          racing successes. This modern interpretation seamlessly combines
          classic aesthetics with cutting-edge performance and safety features,
          making it an exceptional choice for enthusiasts looking for a car
          thats equally at home on the track and the street. The heart of this
          beast is a 5.2-liter V8 engine, purportedly delivering a robust 600
          horsepower, although a dyno sheet is not included to verify this
          claim. The power is efficiently routed to the rear wheels through a
          responsive 6-speed manual transmission. Engine and Transmission:
